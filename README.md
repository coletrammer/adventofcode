## Placement on Leaderboards

After 2024, there is no longer a global leaderboard.

### 2025

## Running the Solutions

Since I created separate repositories for the years 2021 and 2022, they have been added as git submodules. Additionally,
the 2023 solutions depend on my own C++ libraries, which are also included as git submodules. To clone this repository
with the submodules, use the following command:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ColeTrammer/adventofcode.git
```

### C++ Code Organization

The source code is located in the `src` directory. Each day has a solution file `$year/$day.cpp`, in a directory of the
form `01`, `02`, etc.

```bash
cmake --preset clang_release_default
cmake --build --preset clang_release_default

export PATH="$(realpath ./build/clang/release):$PATH"
export DAY=01
export YEAR=2023

aoc -y $YEAR -d $DAY
```

The input files are located in the `input` directory. The solution by default reads a file named
`input/$YEAR/input_$DAY.txt` in the current working directory, but can be changed by passing the path to the input file
as a command line argument:

```bash
aoc -y $YEAR -d $DAY -i input.txt
```

To get the solution to part b, pass the `-b` flag:

```bash
aoc -y $YEAR -d $DAY -b
```

To run against the problem provided sample input (named `$YEAR/test_$DAY.txt`), pass the `-t` flag:

```bash
aoc -y $YEAR -d $DAY -t
```

### Utility Scripts

The `scripts` directory contains a number of utility scripts for interacting with the advent of code website. The
scripts require an environment variable named `AOC_SESSION` to be set to the value of the `session` cookie on the advent
of code website. The scripts perform the following functions:

| Script Name   | Description                                                                                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `download.sh` | Downloads the input file for the given year and day.                                           |
| `new.sh`      | Add source code and input stubs for solving a new problem day.                                 |
| `open.sh`     | Opens the advent of code website for the given year, day and part in the default browser.      |
| `start.sh`    | Calls `new.sh`, and then `open.sh` and `download.sh` as soon as the problem becomes available. |
| `submit.sh`   | Submits the solution for the given year and day. The solution is provided on stdin.            |

### 2022 Past Solutions

The rust solutions for 2022 are located in the `adventofcode2022` directory. Each day has its own rust project, named
`day01`, `day02`, etc. To compile and run a solution, use the following commands:

```bash
DAY=01
cd adventofcode2022/day$DAY
cargo update # This may be required if the Cargo.lock file is out of date
cargo run --release
```

The input files are located in the `adventofcode2022/day$DAY/input.txt` file. The solution defaults to reading a file
named `input.txt` in the current working directory, but can be changed by passing the path to the input file as a
command line argument:

```bash
cargo run --release -- --input input.txt
```

To get the solution for part b, pass the `--part-b` flag:

```bash
cargo run --release -- --part-b
```

To run against the problem provided sample input (named `test.txt`), pass the `--test` flag:

```bash
cargo run --release -- --test
```

### 2021 Past Solutions

The rust solutions for 2021 are located in the `adventofcode2021` directory. Each day has its own rust project, named `day1`,
`day2`, etc. To compile and run a solution, use the following commands:

```bash
DAY=1
cd adventofcode2021/day$DAY
cargo update # This may be required if the Cargo.lock file is out of date
cargo run --release
```

The input files are located in the `adventofcode2021/day$DAY/input.txt` file. The solutions are hard-coded to read a
file named `input.txt` in the current working directory.

### 2020 Past Solutions

The C++ solutions for 2020 are located in the `adventofcode2020` directory. The solutions files are named `1.cpp`, `2.cpp`,
etc. To compile and run a solution, use the following commands:

```bash
DAY=1
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build
./build/$DAY
```

The input files are hardcoded as strings in the source code.
